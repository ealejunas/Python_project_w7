# Python_project_w7 - Project title

The project looks at the skill migration data for several countries. The main idea is to produce statistical analysis invloving mean, standard deviation, top 10, botom 10 and kurtosis measures so that insights could be provided which skills are the most emigrating or imigrating from a country. For instance, positive number in a data set means imigration of a skill, whereas negative number means emigration of the skill. Classes and methods were mainly used to build up a project. This allowed to keep the code clean, maintainable and readable. Also, for loops helped to find and store values in a list so that statistical operations could be carried out later. What is more, class instance  was created to get the data necessary data to proceed with analysis.

## Getting Started

Main steps to make the project complete:

1) Read the excel file with data
2) Import the file.py to another .py file, where your analysis methods will be created
3) Create a class for statistical analysis, and define methods within this class
4) Create another file, say main.py and run the project on this file, calling methods directly

### Modules used

Main modules included: scipy.stats, statistics, openpyxl
